          <p class="lead">Starting a blog can be fun and rewarding, and there is a wealth of benefits that can grow from producing your own blog. It can help you grow your audience, or will help you with your online presence. No matter what is your goal, I can help you gain essential information about how to start a blog.</p>
		  <h1>Choose a blogging platform or hand-code like me</h1>
		  <p>There are many blogging platforms. You can choose WordPress, Joomla, Wix, Blogger and so on. The internet is developing each day everyday so the platforms are too. You can choose to have a free trial or go with the basics of each of those platforms which enables you the user and creator to practice and choose which one is working better for you. </p>
		  <p>Personally, I had a small journey with WordPress, I get it why it is such a popular platform for designers, but I do prefer myself to being a computer geek and make my life harder so I hand-code my own websites and small projects.</p>
		  <h1>Find your desired host and domain name</h1>
		  <p>If you decide you want to practice and have a go at the free options, you can always keep your WordPress or other platforms’ free hosting option. If you want to go extra, and be more professional and have more fun, you can upgrade these by paying monthly which is billed yearly.</p>
		  <p>Other option for you is to search for hosting companies. Here- this is not a fun stuff to do if you are not a patient person. You need to consider things such as:</br></br>
			1.	What packages they have and what it is offered (price)</br>
			2.	Support offered; how long they take to solve the issue, downtime</br>
			3.	Traffic amount, emails, space and so on</br>
			4.	If the host allows WordPress installation and plugins</br></p>
			<p>The fun part begins here, you need to think of a perfect domain name for your blog. Also, you need to make sure it is not taken by others. Here, the hosting companies or domain checker online can help you with domain availability. Those are the things to be considered when choosing your domain name:</br></br>
			1.	Make it easy/short or memorable to type</br>
			2.	Avoid numbers and special keys like $%^()^& and so on. </br>
			3.	Try get a domain name where it matches the niche you are going with.</br></p>
			<h1>Time to design your blog </h1>
			<p>The design of your blog is essential, as it should mirror well with your blog’s purpose and brand. Here you have plenty of freedom. If you decided to use a blogging platform then you can use millions of free or paid templates to give you a head start. Or you can hand-code as me but this takes courage and interest in scripting languages such like HTML and CSS. Basically, the templates are limitless and are a go to option for beginners and for people who do not want to code a lot.</p>
			<p>While you think of the design you should consider, colour scheme, brand name (if applicable) and other factors. As the free templates are customizable too, you can choose your font, colours, layout and so on. Whatever you choose needs to be visually attractive, but also functional. Remember, do not overdose the design as it might make the audience click away from your website as soon as they saw it.</p>
			<h1>Essentials of a blog</h1>
			<p>The contact page alongside with an about page should exist on every webpage, not only on blogs. No matter what is your topic or business idea, those are the essentials. People reading your webpage, blog post will want information about what is the purpose under all of it. Who is doing the blog, how to contact you and so on.</p>
			<p>The contact page is more of an informative place. Here you can add your address, phone number, email and a map where your business is based if wanted. Alongside with all of this information, you can add a contact form where a user is enabled to send you a message. </p>
			<p>The about can be used to introduce the project, idea, blog. You can write about yourself, why you have started the blog or business and what are the goals of it. If it’s a hobby blog then that may not be relevant, but you may still have ambitions for the blog that could be fun to share. Remember, people are curious and if you put some information on then it is more likely that people will follow your blog journey.</p>
			<h1>The Social Media and Content</h1>
			<p>This is a powerful “tool” to use these days. We all use social media to communicate, exchange and look up some information. You as a blogger or business owner or even if you do your blog as a hobby, you should consider putting your time into social media marketing in order to gain audience for your blog. </p>
			<p>Another important part of blogging is content; do not make it too long or too short. This is essential, but remember do not over do it. If you have too much text then people will get bored and simply leave. In order to write a good piece of text you need to have it proof read as no one likes grammar errors. Get engaging graphics- this can be created or you can get it from internet whenever you are allowed to use it in your blog. Do not forget about icons- those are the life changer. </p>
